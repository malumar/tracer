`Tracer` is a logging package designed for event logging with a focus on sensitive data. It allows applications to log events that need to be archived securely, ensuring that sensitive information is not stored in default logs. The package complements existing logging solutions by providing an additional layer of control over which events and data are logged and archived, without exposing sensitive details unnecessarily.
